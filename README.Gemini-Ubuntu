The distributed pre-compiled version of the flasher for Linux is dynamically 
linked against libpng v1.6.  Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 have libpng 
v1.2.  To run the flasher on these releases it needs to be compiled from 
source.

In addition to basic development tools and the source from Github at least the 
following dependencies will need to be fulfilled.
 * qt4-dev-tools (and dependencies)
 * libqtwebkit4
 * libqtwebkit-dev

(sudo apt-get -y install qt4-dev-tools libqtwebkit4 libqtwebkit-dev)

Once compiled the binary executable will be in ${repo}/../_Output 

e.g. source in ~/gitrepo/SP-Flash-Tool-src will lead to the executable (and 
all the compiled objects from which it is linked) being in ~/gitrepo/_Output.
